# Standard for Public Code Jekyll theme

[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for the set up of quick generic static sites and for use with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The Standard for Public Code uses this on all of its website for consistency and maintainability. It is designed to keep as much content as possible in Markdown to preserve mutability. [Read more about how this codebase is updated and who's involved in decisionmaking](/governance.md).

## Building locally

This theme is built to run predictably on GitHub pages, therefore the [`github-pages`](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem is required. Run `bundle install` before building with Jekyll.

To serve locally with Jekyll, use `script/serve.sh`

## Customising

### Table of contents

#### For your whole site

You can turn on the display of Table of Contents ('On this page' section) for any page by adding `toc: true` to the `_config.yml`

#### For just a specific page

Or adding `toc: true` to the front matter of any page where you want the Table of Contents to display.

### Breadcrumbs

You can turn on breadcrumbs for every page on the site by adding `show_breadcrumbs: true` to the `config.yml`.

Will result in breadcrumbs like:

> Main index.md title > grandparent index.md title > parent index.md title

:warning: This will slow down the build as the partial needs to find the indexes and titles for every breadcrumb. This will likely add quite a bit of time to the generation of your site.

### Metadata

If available, the metadata for a post will be displayed next to it. You can add metadata by adding front-matter as follows:

```markdown
---
type: Guide
explains: something or other to put in this text here or there or everywhere wherever it makes sense
author: Ben
audience: Everyone
expires: 2019-04-22
bpmn: process.bpmn
---
```

The `expires` date is rendered by javascript and will highlight when expired.

The `bpmn` takes a filename and will draw a BPMN diagram.

### Redirecting from a page

In order to redirect a page use the `redirected` layout by adding the following front-matter:

```yaml
type: Resource
layout: redirected
sitemap: false
redirect_to: https://example.net/some-url
```
### Footer

You can remove the footer with the contact information and higher level navigation to the footer by setting `hide_foundation_footer: true` in the `_config.yml`.

### Navigation

⚠️ This feature is experimental and might be removed.

You can turn on the navigation by adding `show_navigation: true` to the `_config.yml`. The position of items can be set on the `order` property in the front-matter or in the `_config.yml`. You can hide a page by setting `hidden: true`.

### Rendering the title seperately

You can render the title, which is often automatically extracted as the first `H1` in the document by setting the [Jekyll titles from headings](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-titles-from-headings) to strip the titles:

```yaml
titles_from_headings:
  strip_title: true
```

### Language

The `lang` configuration is used in the `html` tag `lang` attribute.
